## Free Forever

|APN State| Discription |
|---|---|
|Foreground |Notifications are immediately delivered to your app and displayed to the user.|
|Background|Notifications are queued by APNs and delivered when the app enters the foreground or is woken up for background tasks.|
|Terminated|Notifications are stored on the device until the app is launched again. You cannot directly interact with them, but you can retrieve their payload when the app opens.|
